**Crime Data Analysis Using Machine Learning**

This study analyzes crime patterns using the "Crime and Communities" dataset from the UCI Repository. The dataset consists of numerical features, making it suitable for machine learning applications. Crime attributes such as Murder, Robbery, Assault, and Theft were predicted using various models.

Key features like demographics, urban population, and community codes were used to train models. Missing state information was enriched using external data.

Machine learning techniques applied include K-Means, GMM, Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and PCA for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.

This analysis helps predict crime occurrences and provides insights for law enforcement decision-making.
